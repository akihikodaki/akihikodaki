## Telling Something to Me

If you thank me or something, just please give a star on GitHub.
If you have a question on this document, comment on GitHub.

If you want to tell me anything else or if you don't want to use GitHub, use one of the current identities shown the above.

I'm kind of talkative so feel free.

## Characteristics

I'm a human so I have human characteristics (e.g. I operate best in 20-30 celsius degree). Other characteristics are:

- I have never left Japan and am optimized for its environment. I'm a native Japanese speaker.
- I have English language ability sufficient to write this.
- I prefer FLOSS.
- I'm kind of a low-level programmer and familiar with C language. I occasionally wrote MIPS, ARM, and C++. I read x86-64 for debugging but my understanding is kind of fragile.
- I have some knowledge of UI programming paradigms since I learned them to build [Mux](https://github.com/pixiv/Mux), a UI programming thing for Unity, and coded some Web applications.
- I use GNU/Linux with GNOME.
- I prefer to work in a team because humans are interesting by nature and a team also helps me determine my role. However, it is also fine for me to work alone.
- I do any kind of programming if I'm sufficiently motivated.
- I'm from Ibaraki.
- I love chocolate.

### pixiv Inc.

#### July, 2017 - June, 2018

I was employed as a part-time worker for developing [Pawoo](https://pawoo.net/), a variant of [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), a federated microblogging software.

Mastodon is Web application and built with [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/). It has RESTful APIs and [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/), a federation protocol. The UI is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and its state is managed with [Redux](https://redux.js.org/). It stores data to [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [Redis](https://redis.io/). I developed for all of its subsystems.

Speaking of Pawoo-specific feature development, I assisted the full-time workers of the team and developed a feature relatively independent of the other aspects of the software.

- Contributed to [Mastodon](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/pulls?q=author%3Aakihikodaki).
- Contributed to [rspec-sidekiq](https://github.com/philostler/rspec-sidekiq/pull/141).
- Developed Pawoo Music, a discontinued variant of Mastodon. I was responsible for a feature to generate a music video suitable for video-sharing websites like YouTube and Twitter. The feature had the interactive preview and the actual video was generated on the server.
  - Contributed to [PixiJS](https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aakihikodaki+is%3Aclosed)
  - Contributed to [headless-gl](https://github.com/stackgl/headless-gl/pull/115)
  - I developed [the application](https://github.com/pixiv/musicvideo-generator) and determined the server configurations for accelerated graphics.
- Suggested and conducted an experiment to integrate Mastodon and [Matrix](https://matrix.org), although it was suspended before yielding any results and canceled later. Contributed to Matrix (https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aakihikodaki+is%3Aclosed) in the process.

#### July, 2018 - March, 2019

I was relocated for developing [VRoid Studio](https://vroid.com/studio), a software to build humanoid 3D models without special expertise. For details of the application, see [a presentation given at _SA '21: SIGGRAPH Asia 2021 Real-Time Live!_](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3478511.3491311)

My involvement began just before its first release. My focus was to improve the productivity of the team because the relocation was regarded as "temporal" in the first place.

- Constructed and maintained a CI infrastructure with [Unity](https://unity.com), Linux, and [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/). GitLab CI was managed by a colleague so I wrote application-specific code and communicated with him for the integration.
- Designed and implemented [Mux](https://github.com/pixiv/Mux), a tool to build the UI with [XAML (eXtensible Application Markup Language)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/xaml/xaml-basics/) and [data binding](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/app-fundamentals/data-binding/), and re-implemented the UI of VRoid Studio with Mux.
- Minor FLOSS contributions
  - Fixed many bugs of Xamarin.Forms' XAML processor used in Mux. https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/pulls?q=author%3Aakihikodaki+
  - Contributed to XR.Baboon https://github.com/inorton/XR.Baboon/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aakihikodaki+is%3Aclosed
  - Contributed to docfx https://github.com/dotnet/docfx/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aakihikodaki+is%3Aclosed
  - Contributed to UniVRM https://github.com/vrm-c/UniVRM/pull/21
  - Contributed to UniGLTF https://github.com/ousttrue/UniGLTF/pull/15

#### May, 2019 - August, 2019

I was employed as a full-time worker, and had some training in April. Later, I joined the development of [VRoid Mobile](https://vroid.com/mobile), designed for more casual humanoid model creation and including AR feature. I left the team just after its release.

- Designed the architecture of the application as whole. (It was modeled as MVVM and integrated subsystems designed and implemented independently.)
- Clicked the "New Project" button of Unity and wrote the integration of different subsystems and many of its UI components (of course in Mux).
- Ported the CI infrastructure developed for VRoid Studio.
- Instructed other developers to enforce the application architecture and Mux best practices and to provide some generic programming advices. My intention was to maintain the steady development until the release and after I left.
- Minor FLOSS contributions
  - Contributed to bitrise/steps-cache-push https://github.com/bitrise-steplib/steps-cache-push/pull/32
  - Contributed to better-apk-expansion https://github.com/auxility/better-apk-expansion/pull/16

#### September, 2019 - October, 2019

Technically I had never had the "On-the-Job Training", so I completed it by temporarily working for [ImageFlux](https://www.sakura.ad.jp/services/imageflux/) team.

[WebRTC bindings for .NET, mainly targeting for Unity](https://github.com/pixiv/webrtc) are its results. The library avoids common pitfalls of such bindings like multi-platform support and garbage-collector awareness.

I also contributed to mono/sdb. https://github.com/mono/sdb/pull/58

#### November, 2019 - February, 2020

I was relocated for [pixiv Sketch](https://sketch.pixiv.net/) team. pixiv Sketch is a social network where users can casually post drawings (i.e. it is totally fine to post incomplete works). It has drawing tools and a live broadcast feature.

I had no particular job to do, so I just did any technical things the others don't do.

pixiv Sketch had a *backend* server application providing RESTful APIs representing its resources and *frontends* providing the UI. Such a combination is called Backend-for-Frontend, or BFF. The backend was a Ruby on Rails application, and the frontends were Web, Android, and iOS applications.

I modified the WebRTC library for additional features on iOS like screen-casting with audio and an extra audio configuration. https://github.com/pixiv/webrtc

#### March, 2020 - February, 2021

The backend and the Web frontend of pixiv Sketch was assigned to me. I focused on reliability.

The backend interacted with [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and Redis. The Web frontend provided the UI with React with its state managed with [Fluxible](https://fluxible.io).

- Contributed to ClusterWS/cWS https://github.com/ClusterWS/cWS/pull/35
- Debugged and patched Mozilla Firefox to fix CSRF. https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1605305

### March, 2021

I become an unemployed FLOSS contributor again.

- QEMU https://gitlab.com/search?utf8=✓&search=Akihiko+Odaki&group_id=3038080&project_id=11167699&scope=commits&search_code=false&snippets=false&repository_ref=master&nav_source=navbar
- virglrenderer https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/virgl/virglrenderer/-/merge_requests?scope=all&utf8=✓&state=all&author_username=akihiko.odaki
- UTM https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/pull/2361
- Mutter https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/merge_requests/1737

Actually I'm working on QEMU on macOS. Especially I'm focusing on Virgil 3D, a bridge to expose host OpenGL to guest, and Apple Silicon/M1.

## My Name

### Akihiko (陽彦)

Akihiko is my given name. Aki (陽) means "sun". Hiko (彦) means, well, I don't know.

### Odaki 小田喜

Odaki is my family name. The literal meaning probably just doesn't make sense, but:
- O (小) means "small".
- Da (田) means "rice field".
- Ki (喜) means "happy".

So it may mean "I'm happy with a small rice field" or I don't know. Indeed, I prefer to get things done with smaller code base.
